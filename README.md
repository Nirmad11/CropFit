 Crop Planning, Recommendations and Yield Estimation

CropFit is a web-based application that helps farmers make data-driven decisions using soil data, weather data, and historical yield information.

2️ Crop Cycle Planning  
Suggests the next crop for rotation and provides a simple 12-week field management plan.

3️ District-Wise Suitability  
Shows top-yielding crops for any district using cleaned historical yield datasets.

4️ Profit Estimation  
Calculates revenue, cost, and profit/ha to help farmers make financial decisions.
